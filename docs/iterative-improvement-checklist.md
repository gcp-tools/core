# Iterative Improvement Checklist

This checklist guides the refinement and hardening of the multi-agent, multi-language, artifact-driven GCP automation platform after initial E2E integration.

---

## 1. E2E Workflow Robustness
- [ ] Run the E2E workflow multiple times with different inputs and edge cases.
- [ ] Verify that all artifacts are created, valid, and passed correctly between steps.
- [ ] Confirm that error handling works (simulate agent/API failures, invalid artifacts, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure the workflow recovers gracefully from interruptions or restarts.

## 2. Test Coverage & Quality
- [ ] Review and increase unit test coverage for all agents and orchestrator activities.
- [ ] Add integration tests for cross-language (TS â†” Python) artifact passing.
- [ ] Add negative tests (invalid input, missing artifacts, agent errors).
- [ ] Ensure all tests are deterministic and do not leave behind artifacts or state.

## 3. Artifact & Data Handling
- [ ] Validate that all artifact formats match the documented schemas.
- [ ] Test artifact storage in both local and (if applicable) GCS/cloud modes.
- [ ] Add or improve artifact cleanup scripts/utilities.
- [ ] Ensure artifact URIs are always traceable and unique per workflow.

## 4. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Profile workflow execution time; identify and optimize slow steps.
- [ ] Test concurrent workflow runs (multiple orchestrator instances).
- [ ] Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) during E2E runs.

## 5. Developer Experience
- [ ] Simplify local setup (e.g., one-command start for orchestrator + agent API).
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging for both orchestrator and agents.
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ sections to documentation.
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables and config options are documented.

## 6. Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Add a "Quickstart" guide for new developers.
- [ ] Provide example specs, plans, and workflow runs (with sample artifacts).
- [ ] Update diagrams to reflect any workflow or artifact changes.
- [ ] Document any non-obvious conventions or gotchas.

## 7. Extensibility & Modularity
- [ ] Refactor code to make it easy to add new agent types or workflow branches.
- [ ] Ensure agent contracts (input/output schemas) are versioned and documented.
- [ ] Modularize artifact management for easy backend swapping (local/GCS/etc.).
- [ ] Add extension points for future LLM/AI or human-in-the-loop features.

## 8. Feedback & Usability
- [ ] Solicit feedback from at least one other developer or user.
- [ ] Address any pain points, confusion, or friction in the workflow.
- [ ] Track and resolve all "TODO" and "FIXME" comments in the codebase.

## 9. CI/CD & Automation
- [ ] Ensure E2E and integration tests run in CI (GitHub Actions or similar).
- [ ] Add status badges and test coverage reports to the repo.
- [ ] Automate artifact cleanup and environment reset in CI.
