# gcp-tools-mcp & gcp-tools-agents Integration: Enabling Cursor/Warp as the Unified UI

## Overview
This document describes the intended architecture and workflow for integrating **gcp-tools-mcp** (the orchestration/server layer) and **gcp-tools-agents** (the multi-agent automation engine), with **Cursor/Warp** as the primary user interface for developers. The goal is to provide a seamless, developer-friendly experience for scaffolding, reviewing, and deploying GCP projects with human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints and LLM/agent automation.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

- **Cursor/Warp**: The developer's terminal or UI, where all commands, reviews, and approvals are initiated and completed.
- **gcp-tools-mcp**: The central orchestrator. Handles workflow state, triggers agent workflows, manages HITL checkpoints, and exposes APIs/CLI for user interaction.
- **gcp-tools-agents**: The automation engine. Runs agent logic (LLM or stub), produces/consumes artifacts, and exposes agent APIs.

## 2. Workflow: End-to-End Example

1. **User Action**: Developer runs a command in Cursor/Warp, e.g.:
   ```sh
   mcp scaffold my-project
   ```
2. **mcp Orchestration**:
   - Starts a new workflow (e.g., project scaffolding, infra plan, codegen, etc.)
   - Calls the appropriate agent endpoints in gcp-tools-agents for each step.
3. **Agent Execution**:
   - gcp-tools-agents runs the requested agent(s), produces artifacts (plan, code, infra, etc.), and returns results to mcp.
4. **HITL Checkpoint**:
   - At configured points (e.g., after plan/codegen/review), mcp pauses the workflow and notifies the user (via CLI prompt, notification, or UI in Cursor/Warp).
   - User reviews, edits, or approves the artifact in Cursor/Warp (using CLI, editor, or web panel).
   - User submits their decision/input back to mcp.
5. **Workflow Resumes**:
   - mcp resumes the workflow, passing the (possibly edited) artifact to the next agent or step.
6. **Completion**:
   - Workflow completes, and results/artifacts are available for deployment or further review.

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration

- **Checkpoints**: mcp defines where HITL is required (e.g., after plan, codegen, review).
- **Pause/Resume**: mcp can pause a workflow, persist state, and wait for user input.
- **User Notification**: mcp notifies the user in Cursor/Warp (e.g., prints a message, opens a review task, or triggers a UI event).
- **Review/Approval**: User fetches the artifact for review, makes changes if needed, and submits approval or rejection.
- **Resumption**: mcp resumes the workflow with the user's input.

---

## 4. API/CLI Touchpoints

- **Triggering Workflows**: `mcp scaffold`, `mcp deploy`, etc. (CLI commands or API calls from Cursor/Warp)
- **Reviewing Artifacts**: `mcp review --task <id>` or similar, to fetch and submit artifact reviews
- **Status/Progress**: `mcp status <workflow>` to check progress, see pending HITL tasks, etc.
- **Artifact Fetch/Submit**: APIs for downloading/uploading artifacts for review/edit

---

## 5. Artifact Flow

- Artifacts (plan, code, infra, test, review, ops) are serialized (JSON/YAML/etc.) and passed between agents, mcp, and the user.
- Artifacts are stored in a location accessible to both mcp and agents (e.g., local disk, GCS, or in-memory for dev).
- User can edit artifacts in their editor (Cursor/Warp), then submit them back to mcp for workflow resumption.

---

## 6. Extensibility & Best Practices

- **Adding New Agents**: Add new endpoints to gcp-tools-agents; mcp can call them as new workflow steps.
- **Adding New HITL Points**: Configure mcp to pause at new checkpoints; expose new review commands as needed.
- **Custom UI/UX**: Start with CLI, but can add web panels, VSCode/JetBrains extensions, or Warp panels for richer review/approval.
- **Security**: Ensure artifact handoff and user actions are authenticated/authorized as needed.
- **Observability**: Log all workflow steps, agent calls, and HITL actions for traceability.

## 7. Example CLI Flow

```sh
# Start a new project
mcp scaffold my-project

# mcp runs agents, pauses at plan review
# User is notified:
#   "Plan ready for review. Run 'mcp review --task 123' to review."

# User reviews/edits plan in their editor, then submits:
mcp review --task 123 --approve

# Workflow resumes, continues to next HITL or completion
```

---

## 8. Next Steps
- Implement HITL pause/resume logic in mcp
- Expose review/fetch/submit APIs and CLI commands
- Integrate artifact handoff/editing with Cursor/Warp
- Add observability and error handling
- Iterate based on user feedback

---

**This architecture enables a seamless, developer-centric workflow where automation and human expertise work together, all from the comfort of Cursor/Warp.**
